# FlappyBird
This is a remake of Flappy Bird. I made this game so that I can apply some physics properties of Kinematics in my code. 
Click on "src/main/java" file to view all the classes that make up for the game. 
The code in provided just to show my application of kinematics in in this code. 
If the game runs too fast, change the timer delay in lime 43 in runGame.java. This is probably because of different computer speeds. 
For more info, please contanct me at sathurshan03@gamil.com. Thank You!
